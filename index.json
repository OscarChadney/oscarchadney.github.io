One cannot understand electronic circuits without a detailed circuit diagram and the ability to manipulate single circuit elements while recording from others. Similarly, it is impossible to fully understand brain function without being able to identify and manipulate specific neuronal cell types while recording from other circuit elements. For this reason, my laboratory both performs ​in vivo​ recordings from awake, behaving animals, and attempts to generate novel molecular genetic tools capable of driving transgene in specific neuronal cell types, particularly in those parts of the brain involved in learning and memory. Recent years have seen remarkable advances in molecular genetic tools for the elucidation and manipulation of neural circuits, but the means to deliver such transgenes with the requisite specificity has lagged far behind. One can only address the manifest complexity of the brain by co-oping the genetic machinery which underlies it, but while most genes are expressed in the brain, they are unfortunately almost always expressed in multiple cell types. My laboratory has recently taken a novel tactic to address this problem by using transcriptional ​cis​-regulatory sequences specific to particular microdissected brain regions to drive transgene expression in particular cell types of that region, an approach we call Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression (EDGE). Our recent work has shown that EDGE yields anatomical specificity of transgene expression far surpassing that of the parent gene\u0026hellip; i.e. one can obtain high degrees of anatomical specificity from ​nonspecific​ genes. Moreover, these enhancers are typically small enough to fit inside viral vectors, obviating the need for transgenic animals and opening up such anatomically-specific approaches to any species. This last feature not only will bring circuit-specific manipulations to any model species, it has the promise to open up entirely new circuit-specific therapeutic avenues to pathologies of the brain.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5c461b045e9f5eda1f331eede3268544","permalink":"https://oscarchadney.github.io/authors/cliff/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/cliff/","section":"authors","summary":"After his doctoral work on Potassium channels with Bernardo Rudy at NYU, Cliff Kentros investigated the relationship between place cells and memory during his postdoctoral work with Robert Muller at SUNY Downstate and Eric Kandel at Columbia University.

However, not only do the precise genetic mechanisms specifying neuronal cell types remain obscure, access to these neuronal cell types by transgenic techniques also remains elusive. Whereas most genes are expressed in the brain, the vast majority are expressed in many different kinds of neurons, suggesting that promoters alone are not sufficiently specific to distinguish cell types. However, there are orders of magnitude more distal genetic cis-regulatory elements controlling transcription (i.e., enhancers), so we screened for enhancer activity in microdissected samples of mouse cortical subregions. This identified thousands of novel putative enhancers, many unique to particular cortical subregions. Pronuclear injection of expression constructs containing such region-specific enhancers resulted in transgenic lines driving expression in distinct sets of cells specifically in the targeted cortical subregions, even though the parent gene’s promoter was relatively non-specific. These data showcase the promise of utilizing the genetic mechanisms underlying the specification of diverse neuronal cell types for the development of genetic tools potentially capable of targeting any neuronal circuit of interest, an approach we call enhancer-driven gene expression (EDGE).","tags":null,"title":"Marked Diversity of Unique Cortical Enhancers Enables Neuron-Specific Tools by Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":[null],"categories":null,"content":"additional stuff can be added here\n","date":1490140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490140800,"objectID":"11b82de7f8963425aacaef4f1eb317a0","permalink":"https://oscarchadney.github.io/publication/kanter2017/","publishdate":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanter2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The spatial receptive fields of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex layer II (MECII) and in the hippocampus suggest general and environment-specific maps of space, respectively. However, the relationship between these receptive fields remains unclear. We reversibly manipulated the activity of MECII neurons via chemogenetic receptors and compared the changes in downstream hippocampal place cells to those of neurons in MEC. Depolarization of MECII impaired spatial memory and elicited drastic changes in CA1 place cells in a familiar environment, similar to those seen during remapping between distinct environments, while hyperpolarization did not. In contrast, both manipulations altered the firing rate of MEC neurons without changing their firing locations. Interestingly, only depolarization caused significant changes in the relative firing rates of individual grid fields, reconfiguring the spatial input from MEC. This suggests a novel mechanism of hippocampal remapping whereby rate changes in MEC neurons lead to locational changes of hippocampal place fields.","tags":null,"title":"A Novel Mechanism for the Grid-to-Place Cell Transformation Revealed by Transgenic Depolarization of Medial Entorhinal Cortex Layer II","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"21f61a687a07095c8fa3c906ce587658","permalink":"https://oscarchadney.github.io/project/ad/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ad/","section":"project","summary":"a short summary of the ad project.","tags":["molbio"],"title":"AD","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2651a6b1cb6f5e7db387eacbc872d411","permalink":"https://oscarchadney.github.io/project/acc/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/acc/","section":"project","summary":"a short summary of the acc projects","tags":["phys"],"title":"Anterior Cingulate Cortex","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

It is therefore thought that memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex for long-term storage in a process called systems consolidation (Dudai and Morris, 2000). Where in the cortex this occurs remains an open question. Recent work (Frankland et al., 2005; Vetere et al., 2011) suggests the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a likely candidate area, but there is little direct electrophysiological evidence to support this claim. Previously, we demonstrated object-associated firing correlates in caudal ACC during tests of recognition memory and described evidence of neuronal responses to where an object had been following a brief delay. However, long-term memory requires evidence of more durable representations. Here we examined the activity of ACC neurons while testing for long-term memory of an absent object. Mice explored two objects in an arena and then were returned 6 h later with one of the objects removed. Mice continued to explore where the object had been, demonstrating memory for that object. Remarkably, some ACC neurons continued to respond where the object had been, while others developed new responses in the absent object's location. The incidence of absent-object responses by ACC neurons was greatly increased with increased familiarization to the objects, and such responses were still evident 1 month later. These data strongly suggest that the ACC contains neural correlates of consolidated object/place association memory.","tags":null,"title":"Neural Correlates of Long-Term Object Memory in the Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex","type":"publication"}]
